- get idBox from somewhere and pass it in urls
- handle albums for spotify (although playlists handling will have to be done in spotify_cmd, so probably everything including album handling will be done there at the end)
- do something when play/pause/next/prev cmds called
- provide feedback about what's happening (depends two way communcation with arduino)
- announce the box on the LAN using Bonjour/Zeroconf (http://github.com/agnat/node_mdns)
